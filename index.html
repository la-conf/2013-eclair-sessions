          <h2>Lightning talks suck - viva Eclair Sessions!</h2>

<p>Even though <a href="http://2013.la-conf.org">La Conf</a> is not a conference with a Call For Papers, many "rogue" rubyists have submitted talk proposals anyway, eager to stand up on stage and be part of this unusual and exciting event.</p>

<p>It's with a heavy heart and the feeling of missed opportunities that I've had to decline some excellent proposals from some equally excellent speakers.</p>

<p>"There's always the lightning talks" chirped a friend after I explained my problem to him. "Lightning talks?" I replied thougtfully -  it hadn’t even crossed my mind to include them in the schedule.</p>

<h3>So why have lightning talks in the first place?</h3>

<p>Funnily enough, these can sometimes be my favorite part of a conference :</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The shortness of the talk is by far its biggest strength. It means that in a short space of time, you have access to many new ideas, techniques or products. With the clock ticking, presenters strip down their ideas to their essence and I personally love the direct and immediate style of communication that comes from this process. As an added bonus, if I don't like the talk I'm listening to, no sweat - it'll be over in a couple of minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>They're for everyone and about anything. There is no vetting process and no given subject. This freedom is incredible and brings out the best in people and liberates their ideas. Want to quickly amaze your peers? This is the place to do so. I have seen some truly awesome lightning talks and if you've been to a few conferences, I'm sure you have too.</p></li>
<li><p>It's the perfect setting for first timers to get their toes wet and try their hands at speaking in front of a crowd. Lightning talks are a great way to gain precious experience and confidence. Great speakers are not born over night, they need practice too.</p></li>
</ol><h3>Why are there no lightning talks at La Conf then?</h3>

<p>Here's the ironic part, lightning talks can also be my least favorite part of a conference :</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They're generally at the very end of the final day of talks - this is a time when energy levels are at their lowest - certainly not the time for a long session with lots of new ideas being thrown about.</p></li>
<li><p>There are so many talks! I think my personal record must be around 10 consecutive talks, after that I've left the room running for the closest spot of sunshine/beer/whatever is furthest away from my seat. I think I can handle a maximum of 3 or 4 before my attention starts to wander. I've missed out on some great material because I've been eager just to get the hell out of the venue during these talks.</p></li>
<li><p>The talks often feel like an after thought from the organisers. There's no lineup and nothing to get excited about. Sure, if I can remember where the whiteboard with the name of the speaker is scribbled on and if I've heard of him before I <em>might</em> be interested - otherwise there is little incentive to hang around.</p></li>
<li><p>In keeping with the idea of lightning talks being second rate, if the videos are posted online at all, it's as one long video, devoid of speaker names and talk titles. If I want to find a talk that I missed, I have to sift through the whole thing (again)! That's a crappy experience for me and an ungratifying experience for the speaker.</p></li>
</ol><h3>The alternative - Eclair Sessions</h3>

<p>What I'm suggesting is called <strong>Eclair Sessions</strong>. Why Eclair? Firstly because it's the translation of the word "lightning" in French and secondly because it sounds yummy in English (and La Conf is all about <a href="http://2013.la-conf.org/#food">great food</a>).</p>

<p>The aim is to keep what makes a lightning talk so exciting and remove what makes them so taxing. Eclair Sessions work like this :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Speakers announce their talk in advance. This means we can add them to the website, add them to the <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2013/la-conf/">Lanyrd page</a> - and generally treat them the same respect that we treat our other <a href="http://2013.la-conf.org/#speakers">awesome speakers</a> with, kudos and everything.</p></li>
<li><p>A session is composed of no more than 3 or 4 talks lasting 5-minutes each. We don't want to over saturate our conference brains and cause a disconnect. There will be 2 sessions per day at La Conf if there are enough talk proposals to go around.</p></li>
<li><p>The sessions are during the main event and not squeezed in at the end of the day giving the speakers the attention that they deserve.</p></li>
</ul><h3>Sounds great, so how do I participate?</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Proposals are open to all La Conf attendees. Don't have a conference ticket yet? <a href="http://tickets.la-conf.org">Get one here</a> or better yet, get your company to <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/90974nczwdfarjw/La%20Conf%20Sponsorship.pdf">sponsor the conference</a> and bring the whole team along for support.</p></li>
<li><p>Head over to the <a href="http://">Eclair Sessions Page</a>, add your name, your talk title, your email address (for your gravatar) and optionally your company name by the 1st April 2013. The cutoff date is so that we have time to add you to the website and get your talk printed in the conference programe.</p></li>
<li><p>That's it, you’ll be talking in Paris!</p></li>
</ol><h3>Requirements and caveats</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>You must be able to deliver your talk in a reasonable level of English.</p></li>
<li><p>You must be passionate about your subject matter - your job is to inform and to entertain after all.</p></li>
<li><p>You may talk about your product/service/company as long as you respect the previous point.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not have a talk that is in violation of La Conf’s Anti Harassement Policy or that is offensive towards a sponsor. Such talks will be vetoed on the spot. </p></li>
</ol><p>Other than that, have fun and amaze us all!</p>
